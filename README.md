# Optimal Wiring of Heliostats in Solar Tower Power Plants

There is a [project at hand](https://github.com/Jachtabahn/solar-tower/blob/master/project.pdf).

In this project, the use of resources must be optimized to achieve a goal. The optimization of the use of the resources requires complex algorithms and problem reductions. In this case, [this problem reduction](https://github.com/Jachtabahn/solar-tower/blob/master/useful-reduction.pdf) seemed useful to us.

In the end, we came up with an [integer linear program](https://github.com/Jachtabahn/solar-tower/blob/master/integer-linear-program.pdf) for the task.
